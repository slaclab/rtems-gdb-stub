Changes since release 1.4:
  T.S: 2008-04-10
  - BookE single-stepping mode is different from classic PPC. Implemented
    (quick+dirty for now).
    FIXME: needs to be cleaned and unfortunately another RTEMS version check
    is required...
  T.S: 2008-03-20
  Fixes to let it build for different RTEMS versions (4.6.5 .. 4.8.99):
  - crc32.c  use 'uint32_t instead of 'unsigned long'
  - added version-check macro to rtems-stub.c; several features 
    (copying/retrieving object names) and data types (uint32_t, socklen_t,
    PRIx32 format) have changed over time.
  T.S: 2008-01-18
  - rtems-gdb-stub-ppc-shared.c: added check for _SOFT_FLOAT - don't access
    FP regs when compiled for arch that doesn't have any.
  - refuse to break if _Thread_Dispatch_disable_level > 0 (this covers the
    case of ISRs we had already protected against).
  - added support for UDP connections
  - allow 'ttyName' to be any type of device (not just termios). Silently
    ignore failure to read/change/reset termios settings.
  - now works nicely with lanIpBasic standalone IP/UDP stack :-)
Changes since release 1.3:
  T.S: 2007-07-19
  - fix false-positive i386 paranoia check (current CS must be equal to
    CS in exception frame must only compare lower 16-bits!)
  T.S: 2007-07-19
  - fixed printf format warnings by using inttypes.h / PRIx32 & friends
    rather than using explicit formats.
  T.S: 2006-11-30
  - fixed type-punning by using a union for sockaddr/sockaddr_in :(
  - fixed other compiler warnings (mostly printf format details).
  - replaced old rtems 'unsigned32' and similar types by stdint.
  T.S: 2006-08-11
  - BUGFIX: must release startup-synchronization semaphore prior to blocking for
    connections (Thanks to Keith Robertson for reporting this).
Changes since release 1.2:
  T.S: 2006/6/27
  - changed port number from 4444 (leftover from early development lazyness)
    to the officially registered 2159. Thanks to Wolfram Wadepohl for reporting
    this.
Changes since release 1.1:
  T.S: 2006/6/16:
  - switch_stack: free list pointer MUST be declared to point to ALIGNED structs
  - set serial port configuration to mirror what GDB does. This fixed a problem
    (uC5282) where everything seemed to work but binary \000 chars were dropped
    leading to weird memory corruption ('call/print' command). Apparently,
    the checksum algorithm doesn't catch that case!
  T.S: 2006/6/10:
  - m68k (coldfire/uC5282) port.
  T.S: 2005/12/14:
  - cexpSystemModule must be checked for NULL (compiled with cexp support
    but cexp not used).
  T.S: 2005/12/13:
  - fixed typo in i386 variant (must be rtems_gdb_tgt_dump_frame() )
Changes since release 1.0:
  T.S: 2005/12/1:
  - added arch specific routines to dump register/stack contents
    when a thread crashes.
  - removed 'obsolete i/o'.
  - bugfix: when re-attaching to a dead task, list corruption had
    occurred (eventual assertion failure). E.g., if thread 3 ran
    into a segmentation violation then a 't 3, cont, Ctrl-C, t 3'
    sequence would trigger the behavior).
  - a few documentation fixes.
  - updated GDB patches; added patch for gdb-6.3.
  T.S: 2005/11/13:
  - silenced compiler warnings by explicitely casting signed/unsigned
    char types where necessary.
  - bugfix in 'binary memory write [X]': had incremented (*ptr)++
    instead of *(ptr++).
  - abandoned use of _Objects_Copy_name_string() (API changed in 4.6.99;
    to be compatible, we always use _Objects_Copy_name_raw()).
